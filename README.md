# Dungeon Solitaire
## Based on the card game by Matthew Lowes
"Tomb of Four Kings is a fantasy adventure card game
for a single player. With each turn, you defeat monsters, disarm traps, and open doors as you explore a
dark dungeon. Along the way you collect treasure, gain
skills, even use magic. But death awaits those who linger too long, and if all your torches burn out you will
be lost in the dungeon forever. The objective is to find
the tomb hoards of four ancient kings, collect as much
additional treasure as possible, and make it out alive."
